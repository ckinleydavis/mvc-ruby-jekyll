## Installation

 * [Watch Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvzEvrPJH6w) by ProgrammingKnowledge 
 
    **NOTE:** Install Ruby 2.7 as Jekyll has issues with 3.0 version.

After the above installations are complete, run the following commands in the terminal:

    > $ gem install bundler jekyll
    > $ jekyll new <project-name>
    > $ cd <project-name>
    > /<project-name> $ bundle exec jekyll serve

Once the above commands have executed, browse to http://localhost:4000 to see your new app.
